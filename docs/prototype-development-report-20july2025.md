# unfold.quest Prototype Development Report

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Sprint Duration:** One Week  
**Prepared by:** unfold.quest Team

---

## 1. Overview

This report documents the progress of the unfold.quest prototype sprint, comparing planned objectives (see `prototype-development-plan.md`) with actual accomplishments as of July 20, 2025. The prototype is being developed for the European Universities Competition on Artificial Intelligence, aiming to demonstrate an AI-powered mobility companion that transforms journeys in Riga into engaging, narrative-driven micro-quests.

## 2. Summary of Planned Work

The sprint plan outlined five main phases:

1. **Foundation:** Define core data models (`src/core/models.py`)
2. **Building Blocks:** Implement deterministic tools and unit tests (`src/tools/`, `tests/test_tools.py`)
3. **The Brain:** Assemble the LangGraph agent workflow (`src/agent/`)
4. **The Interface:** Build the Gradio UI and connect the agent (`app.py`)
5. **Polish & Documentation:** Refine, document, and prepare for submission (`docs/`, READMEs, ADRs)

## 3. Achievements vs. Plan

### **Stage 1: Foundation – Data Models**
- **Planned:** Implement Pydantic models for POI, TransitLeg, WalkingLeg, Quest.
- **Achieved:**
  - `src/core/models.py` fully implemented with robust Pydantic models and validation.
  - Models are used throughout the agent and tools for type safety and data integrity.

### **Stage 2: Building Blocks – Deterministic Tools**
- **Planned:** Implement POI and transit tools; write unit tests.
- **Achieved:**
  - `src/tools/poi_retriever.py` and `src/tools/transit_planner.py` implemented with:
    - Efficient data loading, geospatial search, and GTFS parsing.
    - Public APIs for agent integration.
  - **Comprehensive unit tests** in `tests/test_tools.py`:
    - 26+ tests covering all tool functions, error handling, and edge cases.
    - Mock data fixtures ensure fast, reliable, and isolated testing.

### **Stage 3: The Brain – Agentic Workflow**
- **Planned:** Assemble LangGraph agent, define state, implement nodes and logic.
- **Achieved:**
  - `src/agent/state.py` defines a complete AgentState TypedDict for workflow memory.
  - `src/agent/graph.py` implements all required nodes, conditional routing, and error handling using LangGraph best practices.
  - **Integration tests** in `tests/test_agent.py`:
    - 15+ tests covering all graph paths, node logic, error handling, and state progression.
    - Both mocked and live LLM scenarios are tested.

### **Stage 4: The Interface – Gradio UI**
- **Planned:** Build simple Gradio UI, connect agent, polish UX.
- **Achieved:**
  - `app.py` implements a minimalist, competition-ready Gradio interface.
  - UI follows ADR-003: single textbox, button, markdown output, and examples.
  - Modern Gradio best practices applied (API access, Enter key, error feedback, CSS polish).

### **Stage 5: Polish & Documentation**
- **Planned:** Finalize docs, add comments, prepare submission materials.
- **Achieved:**
  - All major directories (`data/gtfs/`, `data/pois/`) have detailed READMEs with legal and data provenance notes.
  - `docs/` contains:
    - ADRs for all major technical decisions.
    - Data management and project vision documents.
    - This report and the original development plan.
  - Main `README.md` updated with legal disclosure and usage instructions.

## 4. Notable Improvements & Best Practices

- **Test Coverage:**
  - Unit and integration tests provide full coverage for all deterministic and agentic logic.
  - Error handling, edge cases, and fallback logic are thoroughly tested.
- **LangGraph Compliance:**
  - Agent workflow follows latest LangGraph documentation and patterns.
  - Conditional routing, node modularity, and state management are robust.
- **Modern UI:**
  - Gradio interface is user-friendly, visually clean, and ready for demonstration.
  - API endpoints and example caching enabled for rapid prototyping.
- **Documentation:**
  - All code and data directories are documented for reproducibility and legal compliance.
  - ADRs and development plan are up to date and reflect actual decisions.

---

## 5. Remaining Tasks & Next Steps

- **Final Polish:**
  - Add a favicon and further UI polish if time allows.
  - Record a demonstration video/GIF for submission.
- **Submission Materials:**
  - Draft the 3,000-word competition proposal based on completed documentation and prototype.
- **Stretch Goals:**
  - Add more POI data or GTFS updates if new data becomes available.
  - Explore additional UI features (e.g., loading indicators, map integration) if time permits.

## 6. Conclusion

The unfold.quest prototype sprint is on track and has delivered a robust, well-tested, and fully documented vertical slice of the intended product. All core objectives from the development plan have been met or exceeded. The project is ready for final polish and submission to the European Universities Competition on AI.
